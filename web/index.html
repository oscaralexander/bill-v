                <h1>We are Bill V</h1>
                <p>
                    Meet Robert Jan and Patrick de Laive, brothers by DNA, business partners by choice, entrepreneurs by day.
                    Together we form Bill V.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bill V is a not so typical investment fund, managed by us in the weekends (we have a day-to-day) and backed by Friends of Bill.
                    Bill participates in companies across several stages of their cycle and in various sectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We help founders with product, business modelling, GTM strategy, brand building and intros through the widespread network of Bill and its Friends.
